# psd2json

Exports Photoshop documents to sets of images and JSON metadata including layer
names, positions, sizes, blend modes, opacities, etc.

Note this is not a self-contained script - you still need to call its
exportDocument function for it to do anything.

Makes use of Node/NPM/CommonJS-style modularization through
[extendscript-commonjs](https://github.com/yellcorp/extendscript-commonjs)
